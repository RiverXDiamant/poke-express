Learning Objectives

    Practicing index and show, new and create routes with express

The User Stories

    When a user goes to the /pokemonroute they will see an indexof pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.
    When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's showpage, and will see the pokemon's name and image.

Let's Start Catching 'em All!

The User Stories

    When a user goes to the /pokemon route they will see an index of pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.
    When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's show page, and will see the pokemon's name and image.
    When a user goes to /pokemon/new a user sees a form that allows them to create a brand new pokemon, and then redirects the user back to /pokemon

Instructions
    Below We will walk you through setting up your app making your first commits and getting started with INDEX and SHOW
    NEW and CREATE Will be totally up to you, you won't find any instructions below about how to set them up, it's up to you.
    Use your notes from today and your fruits and vegetables app to make the New and Create Routes Correctly.
    Set up the file structure

In terminal:

    inside your homework folder:
        mkdir pokemon_app
        cd pokemon_app
        mkdir views
        touch views/Index.jsx
        touch views/Show.jsx
        mkdir models
        touch models/pokemon.js
        touch server.js
        touch .gitignore
        npm init -y
    Approximate File Structure

🔴 Commit:
"All my files are created"

Install NPM packages

In terminal:

    Make sure that you are on the same directory level as your package.json (why?)
    npm i express
    npm i express-react-views react@16 react-dom@16
    check your package.json
    Approximate package.json

🔴 Commit:
"All my npm packages are added"

Set up your server

-In your server.jsfile, set up your server

    require express
    set express() to a variable
    set a variable of port to 3000
    set your app to listen to the port and include a console.log(), so that you can tell when your server is running
    include a get route / that will res.send('Welcome to the Pokemon App!'); so that when you got to localhost:3000, you will see Welcome to the Pokemon App!

    In terminal

        nodemon or nodemon server.js (if you set your package.json to start server.js you don't need to put it after nodemon)
            GOTCHA! : nodemon will only work if you run it from the same location as your package.json

    In the browser
        go to localhost:3000
        check that you have your  Welcome to the Pokemon App! message displaying

🔴 Commit:
"My server is set up and running"

Set up your 'database'

    You have created a file called pokemon.js
    Inside of this file, put the following array of pokemon objects. This is your 'database' for tonight's homework, copy and paste it as is! You'll notice the image url's are missing something, this is intentional, do not edit anything directly inside the 'database'!

const pokemon = [
			{name: "bulbasaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/bulbasaur"},
			{name: "ivysaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/ivysaur"},
			{name: "venusaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/venusaur"},
			{name: "charmander", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charmander"},
			{name: "charizard", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charizard"},
			{name: "squirtle", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/squirtle"},
			{name: "wartortle", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/wartortle"}
		 ];

    Set up your 'database' so that it can be exported to your server.js and then be required by your server.js
    Set this 'database' to a variable called pokemon in your server.js file
    Create a get route /pokemon that will res.send(pokemon), which will display your pokemon data as json in the browser

🔴 Commit:
"Connected my database, can see json in the browser"

Set up your index view

    Instead of displaying json at your /pokemon route, you should serve the Index.jsx file you created that will display your pokemon

    You will have to set up your jsx file
        Start with your html boilerplate code
        Add an <h1> that describes this page, i.e. 'See All The Pokemon!'
        Try adding some inline styles:

        We can add inline CSS, which are specified as attributes and are passed to the elements. These are specified as an object with a key as camelCased style name & value being the actual style value (and not as a string).

        const myStyle = {
        color: '#ffffff',
        backgroundColor: '#000000',
        };

        class MyFirstComponent extends React.Component() {
        return (
          <div style={myStyle}>My First React Component!</div>;
        }
        }

    Change your /pokemon route to res.render your Index.jsxfile
    In your browser, go to localhost:3000/pokemon and be sure to see your Index.jsx view with an h1 tag

🔴 Commit:
"index.jsx view rendered at pokemon route"

Set up your index view to show your pokemon data

    Continue working on your Index.jsx view so that you can see:
        The name of each pokemon, as a list item, inside an unordered list
        This list should be dynamically rendered by jsx based on your data from your 'database'
        You'll notice the pokemon names aren't properly capitalized! Let's fix that! Manipulate the data programatically to capitalize the first letter of their names

🔴 Commit:
"I can view a list of all my pokemon in the browser"

Setting up your show route

    Inside your server.js, add a new get route /pokemon/:id
    That will res.send(req.params.id);
    So, when you go to localhost:3000/pokemon/whatever
    whateverwill show up in the browser

🔴 Commit:
"Show view shows req.params.id "

Link your Index.jsxto your Show.jsx

    Inside your Index.jsx,
        For each pokemon, add an <a>tag that will have an hrefthat goes to the route /pokemon/x, where x is the array position of the pokemonin the data array. This should be set dynamically with jsx
        When you click the link you should go to your show route and the index number corresponding to the pokemon's array position should be displayed

🔴 Commit:
"Added dynamic anchor tags to index.jsx "

Render your individual pokemon in the show view

    Copy/paste your code from your Index.jsx into your Show.jsx`

    Change all your html code inside your Show.jsx file so that
        Your h1 tag says "Gotta Catch 'Em All"
        Add an h2 tag that will display the name of the pokemon
        Add an image tag that will display an image of the pokemon
        Add an anchor tag with the text of back, that will take you back to your Index.jsx view
    Update the route in the server.js to render the show view with the pokemon data
    Oh no! The image is broken because in our database the image links don't have the .jpgending, let's fix that programatically! Without going back to the database and editing it there, add on .jpg to the end of the pokemon's image data

🔴 Commit:
"Created show views of each pokemon"

Part 2 with Pokedex

    Add Model for pokemon
    Rewrite Index Route to use Mongodb
    Rewrite Index View to work with Index Route
    Rewrite Show Route to MongoDB
    Rewrite Create Route to work with MongoDB
    Use New Page to create all the pokemon that were in the original array at minimum
